This is an exploration of the functionalities in the Text Mining package in R.

Some functionalities that have been explored:

- Pre-processing the corpus
  - Removing punctuation, numbers
  - Convert to lower case
  - Remove stop words and stemming of the words
- Clustering
- Word association by frequency
